# MLAnts
A small project exploring [Unity's Machine Learning Agents Toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents), wherein ants were trained to avoid walls, search for food, and return it to their nest. A video showcasing the program is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfGPJqgg3AQ).
